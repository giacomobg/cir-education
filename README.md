## CIR Education project

An interactive map of CIR-recorded instances of damage to educational establishments in the first year of the Ukraine war.

Developed with Svelte
Compiled with Rollup

## Developing

```sh
# if you didn't already install, run the install command
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

Your app will be running at [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

*Note* - if it crashes with no error message (something that started when we changed rollup version), run `pnpm run build` and it should return an error.
